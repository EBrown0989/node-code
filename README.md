# node-code
Simple code examples relating to `Node.js` and `JavaScript`.

Comments are included in code examples to demonstrate how I tested it. I'll also point out dependencies, in case either data files or modules need to be connected in order for the code to function as intended.

I'm using `Atom`, `Bash`, and the `Node.js REPL Terminal` for the most part.
