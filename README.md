# mern-examples

Simple project examples relating to the `MERN` stack.

> Not every project will use the full MERN stack.
> Some may focus on the back-end with node and others the front-end with react.
> I'll attempt to make a note of the used tech in the associated readme for each.

Basically, a collection of tutorial projects I have covered. I'll link sources where applicable,
and set it up in a way that allows me to better review application examples for later reference.

Comments are included in code examples to demonstrate how I tested it. I'll also point out dependencies,
in case either data files or modules need to be connected in order for the code to function as intended.

I'm using `VSCode`, `WSL2 & Ubuntu`, `Postman`, `MongoDB Compass`, & `Docker Desktop`.
