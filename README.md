# mern-examples
Simple project examples relating to the `MERN` stack.
> Not every project will use the full MERN stack. Some may focus on the back-end with node and others the front-end with react. I'll 
attempt to make a note of the used tech in the associated readme for each.


Basically, a collection of tutorial projects I have covered. I'll link sources where applicable, and set it up in a way that allows me to 
better review application examples for later reference.

Comments are included in code examples to demonstrate how I tested it. I'll also point out dependencies, in case either data files or 
modules need to be connected in order for the code to function as intended.

I'm using `Atom`, `Bash`, and the `Node.js REPL Terminal` for the most part.
